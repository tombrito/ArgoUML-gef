/**
 * Cmd to save the current document to a binary file using Sun's
 * ObjectSerialization library. The written file contains the Editor object and
 * all objects reachable through instance variables of the Editor (e.g., the
 * selections, the views, the contents of the views, the net-level description
 * of the graph, etc.). UI objects such as Windows, Frames, Panels, and Images
 * are not stored because I have marked those instance variables as transient in
 * the source code.
 * <p>
 * 
 * One advantage of this approach to saving and loading is that developers using
 * GEF can add subclasses (e.g., to NetNode) which introduce new instance
 * variables, and those will be saved and loaded without the developers having
 * to special load and save methods. However, make sure that you do not point to
 * any AWT objects unless those instance variables are transient because those
 * cannot be saved.
 * <p>
 * 
 * Needs-More-Work: the files produced by a save are not really good for
 * anything other than reloading into this tool, or another Java program that
 * uses ObjectSerialization. At this time GEF provides no support for saving or
 * loading textual representations of documents that could be used in other
 * tools.
 * <p>
 * 
 * @deprecated in 0.12.3 use SaveAction
 * @see CmdOpen
