Installing GEF
--------------

First, you have to unzip the gef archive to a directory of your choice.
It is recommended, that the last part of the resulting path is a
subdirectory called "src". If you use another name for the subdirectory
the build process might fail.

The distribution is built using the Ant build system
(http://jakarta.apache.org/ant).  You will need to have Ant 1.2+.
Once you have Ant installed, you can build the distribution simply
by executing the command:

  ant compile

This will compile all needed source files and copy the necessary helper
files to the build directory. If you plan to use GEF as part of other
projects, you might to build a jar file. Therefore you need to create a
directory called "lib" on the same level your "src"-directory is on. Then
simply type

  ant package

This will do all the things "ant compile" does and additionally build a
jar file called "gef.jar" in your "lib"-directory.

Ant operates similarly to make, but instead of a makefile, Ant uses an
XML build file.  The build.xml file for this distribution has the
several targets. You can type

  ant

to get a list of the currently available targets including a short
description of them.
