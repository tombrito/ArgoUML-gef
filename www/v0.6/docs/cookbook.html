<P><B><FONT COLOR="#006600">Background</Font></B>: Cookbooks are
intented to help people accomplish specific structured tasks.  They
mainly provide process information in the form of a sequence of steps,
and domain-specific knowledge in the form of brief descriptions and
links to background materials.  The format of each cookbook entry
(recipe) is similiar to this one.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#006600">Applicability</Font></B>: You should use a
cookbook when there is a specific task you want to accomplish and
there is a recipe in the cookbook that supports that specific
task. Also, browse the cookbook to see what tasks are supported.

<P><B><FONT COLOR="#006600">Ingredients</Font></B>: Each recipe lists
the matierals that you may need to accomplish the task.  Not all
matierals are needed in all cases.

<LI>Find the recipe by scanning the cookbook's table of contents or
by following a link from javadoc comments in the code or other
documentation.

<LI>Check the "Background" and "Applicability" sections to make sure
that the recipe is what you were looking for. Scan the "Steps" to get
an idea of what you will have to do. Read the "Results" section to see

successfully completed.

or advanced versions of the task.

completed successfully.
